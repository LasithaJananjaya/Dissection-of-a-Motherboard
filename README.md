# Dissection of a Motherboard #
This is a group activity done under the module, EN2031 - Fundamentals of Computer Organization and Design in the 3rd Semester of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

Our task was to select a motherboard from a reputable manufacturer that has been launched within the last five to seven years. It was necessary to conduct a physical inspection of the motherboard and include annotated photographs that clearly indicated the presence of different components. We were then required to meticulously study the specifications and prepare a comprehensive report that includes the following information.

- Identification of main components and their key specifications.
  - Processor, Memory, primary IO components (essential information about each main component must be included).
- Functional Block Diagram indicating all the main components and their inter-connectivity.
- I/O component classification based on their access speeds.
- Connectivity options with their key specifications - Ethernet, USB, PCI etc. Basic familiarity with the protocols used by each peripheral to communicate with the CPU. (Example - Network port - Wired Ethernet or WiFi - through what protocol will it be communicating with the CPU)  
- Cooling Options - Heat Sinks, Fans, Temperature sensors for monitoring.
